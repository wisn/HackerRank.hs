# Contribution Guidelines
## Adding New Solution
Create a new directory if and only if the `problem` is not listed in the list

You must follow the directory structure. It is `domain/subdomain/problem-name.hs`.
For example, `algorithms/warmup/solve-me-first.hs`.

If it is done, you may send a pull request.

Don't worry about the navigation.
I'll manage them.
But, modify the navigation too will be great.
It is awesome if the solution structured as we love too.

## Improving Solution
If you have a better algorithm solution, you may modify and send pull request.
