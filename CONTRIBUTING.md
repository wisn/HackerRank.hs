# Contribution Guidelines
## Adding New Solution
- Create new directory if and only if the `problem` is not listed in the list
- You must follow the directory structure. It is `domain/subdomain/problem/lang/solution.lang`. For example, `algorithms/warmup/solve-me-first/haskell/solution.hs` for the solution in Haskell
- Create your explanation under the language directory in README.md. For example, `algorithms/warmup/solve-me-first/haskell/README.md` for the explanation in Haskell
- If it is done, you may send a pull request.

Don't worry about the navigation. I'll manage them. But, modify the navigation too will be great.
It is awesome if the solution structured as we love too.

## Improving Solution
If you have a better algorithm solution, you may modify and send pull request.
Don't forget to modify the explanation too.
